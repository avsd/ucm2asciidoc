# Conversion of UseCaseMaker file to human-readable formats (html, pdf, etc.) using AsciiDoc

Imported from Google Code.

I used this script to generate blueprints when I worked as a technical
documentation specialist at [Geocell](http://geocell.ge).

##Summary
This is a [Python](http://www.python.org) library and script to convert
[UseCaseMaker 2.0](http://use-case-maker.sourceforge.net/) file to different formats
via [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org).

Use Case Maker is an OpenSource program written on C#, that helps
system developers to easily write Use Cases. The Use Cases may then
be exported as reports, although their format is fixed and can't be
customized. There is no chance to include the Use Cases generated
in such way to other documents.

Goal of this project is to convert UseCaseMaker 2.0 file (which actually
is an XML file) to AsciiDoc source. The latter then could be either
directly compiled to many different presentation formats (docbook,
html, htmlhelp, pdf, plaintext, dvi, PostScript, TeX, etc.) or become
a part of more general documentation, written in AsciiDoc or DocBook.

##Script tool

The library contains a tool called `ucm2asciidoc`. It is a command-line
tool that performs file conversion:

```
    ucm2asciidoc 

    Converts UseCaseMaker file to Use Cases
    in different human-readable formats,
    using AsciiDoc.

    Usage:
        ucm2asciidoc [options] usecasemaker_filename
        
    Options:
        -c, --title-char=TITLECHAR
            Characters for titles. When only one character
            specified, it is used to underline titles of Use Cases.
            If more than one, the first is used to underline
            title of document, the second - to underline titles
            of the Use Cases.
            Default: "=-"
        -f, --format
            Output format. Format can be:
                * asciidoc -- AsciiDoc source
                * docbook -- DocBook XML, generated by asciidoc tool
                * html -- HTML, generated by asciidoc tool
                * chunked -- chunked HTML (a2x)
                * htmlhelp -- HtmlHelp files (a2x)
                * manpage -- MAN page (a2x)
                * pdf -- PDF file (a2x, dblatex)
                * text -- plain text file (a2x)
                * xhtml -- XHTML file (a2x)
                * dvi -- DVI file (a2x, dblatex)
                * ps -- PostScript file (a2x, dblatex)
                * tex -- TeX file (a2x, dblatex).
        -o, --output=FILENAME
            Output file. By default - usecasemaker_filename with
            appropriate extension
        -v, --verbose
            Verbosely print processing information
        -t, --title
            Title of AsciiDoc document. Used only in case when
            --title-char consists of two characters.
            Default: usecasemaker_filename without extension
            
    Notes:
        * To build a separate document default --title-char
          must be used. This option is useful when
          including Use Cases in another AsciiDoc file
          as a section.
        * When using --format other than asciidoc,
          the AsciiDoc must be installed (asciidoc and a2x
          executables must be available).

###Example

Let's see an example. Say, we have an example file called
"SampleUseCase.ucm", consisting
of two Use Cases (the sample could be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/avsd/ucm2asciidoc/blob/master/samples/SampleUseCase.ucm)):

![Sampel Use Case](https://github.com/avsd/ucm2asciidoc/blob/master/samples/SampleUseCase3.png)

If we call `ucm2asciidoc` with filename parameter only,
an !AsciiDoc source will be generated:


    ucm2asciidoc SampleUseCase.ucm


The output is written to `SampleUseCase.asciidoc` file:

```
// ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
// THIS FILE IS GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY - DON'T EDIT!
// ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
// Use Cases retrieved from UseCaseMaker
// XML file with help of ucm2asciidoc script.
// ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

SampleUseCase
=============

Perform login (UC1) 
--------------------

// Description:
This action precedes any other activity between the "User" and the "System",
because the User must be authenticated and logged in to perform anything.

// Labeled list:
--
Pre-Conditions:: 
"User" is not yet logged in.
Post-Conditions:: 
- "User" is logged into the "System"
- Login event is written to the system log.
Trigger (External):: 
"User" starts a work session with the "System"
--

// Notes:
[NOTE]
============================
* System administrator is responsible to give 'username' and 'password' for authentication;
* A secure connection with a server where the "System" is deployed must be established.
============================

// Step Flows:
[cols="3m,12",options="header"]
|==========================================================
|UC1  | Main success scenario
|1 |"User" opens GUI of the "System"
|2 |"System" checks whether "User" is already logged in, and finds that he isn't.
|3 |"System" displays ``Login'' page in the GUI.
|4 |"User" enters his 'username' and 'password' to appropriate fields.
|5 |"User" clicks ``Login'' button.

...
```


###Generating HTML

An HTML output could be generated by running the tool with
`--format` parameter and (optionally) specifying title of the
document:


    ucm2asciidoc --format=html --title="Sample UseCase" SampleUseCase.ucm


To make this example working [http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ AsciiDoc]
should be installed in the System. The result is:

![Sampel HTML](https://github.com/avsd/ucm2asciidoc/blob/master/samples/SampleUseCase5-html.png)


###Generating PDF

To produce PDF and DVI outputs, [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) or 
[MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) (for Windows) have to
be installed. Also, AsciiDoc requires [dblatex](http://dblatex.sourceforge.net/)
to create TeX from DocBook. By running the command:


    ucm2asciidoc --format=pdf --title="Sample UseCase" SampleUseCase.ucm


we get a PDF file, named "SampleUseCase.pdf":

##Installation

To install ucm2asciidoc tool:

 * Download and install [Python](http://www.python.org/download/);
 * Download ucm2asciidoc and install it;
 * To produce HTML and DocBook output, [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org) must be installed;
 * To produce PDF, DVI and other formats under Linux, install LaTeX and dblatex;
 * To produce PDF, DVI and others under Windows, you need to install MiKTeX, download dblatex and make it working.
